# Portal

[![](https://tokei.rs/b1/github/portal-rs/portal)](https://github.com/portal-rs/portal)

Portal is a DNS server written in pure Rust. This project has two purposes:

- Challenge me to write more Rust code
- Extend the features of the initial Go implementation

Some time in the future this maybe will be production ready.
